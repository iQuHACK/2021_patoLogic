# This program demonstrates a basic Ocean program that runs an Ising problem 
# on the D-Wave QPU. 

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Import the functions and packages that are used
from dwave.system import EmbeddingComposite, DWaveSampler

# Define the problem as two Python dictionaries: 
#   h for linear terms, J for quadratic terms
h = {} 
J = {('A','K'): -0.5, 
    ('B','C'): -0.5, 
    ('A','C'): 0.5} 

# Define the sampler that will be used to run the problem
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())

# Run the problem on the sampler and print the results
sampleset = sampler.sample_ising(h, J, num_reads = 10)
print(sampleset)
