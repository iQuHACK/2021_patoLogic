# This program demonstrates a basic Ocean program that creates a
# BinaryQuadraticModel with a non-zero offset to store a constant term. 

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Import the functions and packages that are used
from dwave.system import EmbeddingComposite, DWaveSampler
from dimod import BinaryQuadraticModel

# Define the problem as a Python dictionary and convert it to a BQM
Q = {('B','B'): 1, 
    ('K','K'): 1, 
    ('A','C'): 2, 
    ('A','K'): -2, 
    ('B','C'): -2}
    
bqm = BinaryQuadraticModel.from_qubo(Q, offset=1.0)

# Define the sampler that will be used to run the problem
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())

# Run the problem on the sampler and print the results
sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads = 10)
print("QUBO samples:")
print(sampleset)

# Convert the problem to an Ising model and run it on the sampler
bqm.change_vartype('SPIN')
sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads = 10)
print("\nIsing samples:")
print(sampleset)
